<h6>Release Date</h6> 7 October 2018

<h6>Description</h6> Centipede Wars is a 2D PC game based on the original Atari arcade game, Centipede.

<h6>Game Rules</h6> The centipede is the main enemy in the game. You can move the player using the arrow keys and shoot lasers 
using the left control button. If the centipede hits you, you lose a life. Hitting the centipede causes it to split and the
destroyed segment turns into a mushroom. Mushrooms are generated randomly on the field and take four shots to destroy. They also cause the centipede to drop
one level and change direction. DDT Bombs have a random chance of appearing. There can be a maximum of four on the playing field
at one time. Shooting a DDT Bomb destroys all enemies and objects within its blast radius, however, it does not result in a 
decrease in the length of the centipede should you lose a life. You can increase your score by shooting the centipede, mushrooms
and DDT Bombs. If you get a high score, you can enter your name and it will be displayed after the game. Winning is
done by destroying all centipedes while losing occurs when you lose all three lives.
